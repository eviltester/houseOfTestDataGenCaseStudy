# House Of Test - Data Generation Java Technical Testing Case Study

Source code for the House Of Test - Data Generation Java Technical Testing Case Study.

The notion of 'source' is a little misleading. This is a single `@Test` method in an `Test` `.java` file.

The `pom.xml` was really just to create a basic project in IntelliJ to use the inbuilt IntelliJ decompiler.

The source code is the code used to 'test' the random generation. This won't work unless you add the data generation tool as a dependent jar as described in the case study videos.
